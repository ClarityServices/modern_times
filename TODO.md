TODO
========

 * jms/consumer.rb - is it needed? is dummy stuff needed?
 * Better API documentation
 * jms_test and jms_requestor_test don't exit
 * Responses aren't non-persistent?  Why are timed out responses ending up in the DLQ?
 * RequestWorker needs option for failure queue as well as sending exception in response
 * Batch file handling coming soon
 * More thorough test coverage, especially the various options, Railsable, etc.
